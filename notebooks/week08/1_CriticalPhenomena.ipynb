    "The sand-pile model is idealised with highly oversimplifed laws of motion. *However*, it successfully explains the behaviour of diverse phenomena such as earthquakes or forest fires\n",
    "\n",
    "So much of life and nature seems to be poised at criticality. e.g. large earthquakes and some kinds of accidents are fundamentally unpredictable\n",
    "\n",
    "There is strong support and empirical evidence suggesting that SOC is key to understanding how the world works\n",
    "- Per Bak (1997, title) claims to have discovered ‘how nature works’\n",
    "<!-- - Creutz (1997, p. 147) thinks that ‘[t]he idea provides a possible “explanation” of the omnipresent multi-scale structures throughout the natural world’ (my emphasis)\n",
    "- Paczuski and Bak (1999, p. 2) assert that ‘punctuated equilibrium [i.e. SOC] dynamics is the essential dynamical process for everything that evolves and becomes complex’ (my emphasis)\n",
    "- Blanchard and co-workers (1999, p. 375) observe that SOC has become a ‘new paradigm for the explanation of a huge variety of phenomena in nature as well as social science’\n",
    "- Buchanan (2000, title) thinks that SOC is ‘ubiquitous’ and has discovered ‘why the world is simpler than we think’ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "But is SOC ubiquitous? And in what sense is SOC a general feature of nature? \n",
    "\n",
    "We still don't know\n",
    "\n",
    "SOC is no longer seen as the sole framework to explain multi-scale phenomena\n",
    "\n",
    "It is now understood as part of a broader collection of mechanisms (including the importance of network topologies and non-equilibrium models), rather than a universal theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we do know is that it is impossible to look at the state of a critical system and say whether a large avalanche is 'due'. If the system is in a critical state, then a large avalanche is always possible... It just depends on the next grain of sand."
