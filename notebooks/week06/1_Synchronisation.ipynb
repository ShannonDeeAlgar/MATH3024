    "**Early theories:** Twitching eyelids, human tendency to see patterns where there are none, fireflies' light-producing organs being aligned by the wind\n",

    "**Physically:** neurotransmitter triggers a chemical reaction in the lantern. (It's not really known how they control the flashing. The current theory is something to do with oxygen regulation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation:** courtship rituals, a sort of dialogue allowing males and females to locate each other. Species-specific on/off light pattern repeated periodically. Male fireflies are reinforcing the message to the females. If the female is interested, she waits some time before making a flash of her own\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- *'A male would fly about a metre off the ground. Every 15 seconds or so, he makes several consecutive flashes, one second apart. The female P carolinus stays closer to the ground in low vegetation. If the female is interested, she waits two seconds before making a half-second flash of her own at the third second.'* https://aeon.co/essays/how-firefly-flashes-illuminate-the-physics-of-complex-systems -->\n",
