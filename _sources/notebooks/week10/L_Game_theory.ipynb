    "Game theory was first formalised by John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern in their landmark 1944 book *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior*. It gained prominence during the Cold War, when strategists sought mathematical tools to analyse conflict, negotiation, and deterrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its heart, game theory is the quantitative study of strategic interaction. It provides a framework for situations with multiple decision makers, or players, where the outcome for each individual depends not only on their own choices but also on the choices of others. This makes game theory a natural companion to the study of complex systems, many of which involve interacting agents (people, organisms, firms, or institutions etc) whose local decisions shape collective behaviour. \n",
    "\n",
    "Game theoretic models shed light on why rational self-interest often leads to tension between what is best for the individual and what is best for the group. Traditionally, they have focused on small, stylised settings with only a few players, making the mathematics manageable and the strategic logic clear. With greater computing power and advances in complex systems theory, game-theoretic insights about incentives and stability can now be embedded within large-scale models, linking clear strategic reasoning to rich collective dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll use the **Prisoner’s Dilemma** to explore the basics of game theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "It’s the most famous example in the field. First discussed in the 1950s, it captures the paradox at the heart of many complex systems — that rational choices at the individual level can undermine the collective good."
